## 🚀This project includes:
 - 🕰️Calculation of minimum and maximum time of time interval.
 - ⏳Calculation and partitioning of time interval into time sub-intervals.
 - 📽️Presentation of the subnetworks in each time sub-period through calculation of adjacency matrices.
 - 📊Calculation and graphical presentation of the distribution of centrality measures for each of the calculated subnetworks:
   - Degree Centrality
   - In-Degree Centrality
   - Out-Degree Centrality
   - Closeness Centrality
   - Betweenness Centrality
   - Eigenvector Centrality
   - Katz Centrality
 - 🧮 Calculation of $`Ε^*[t_{j-1},t_j]`$, $`V^*[t_{j-1},t_{j+1}]`$ and $`Ε^*[t_j,t_{j+1}]`$ sets for $`N=[1,N]`$, for every two temporally consecutive networks.
 - 🔢 Calculation of similarity matrices for each pair of nodes and each set from $`V^*`$ base on the edges of set $`Ε^*[t_{j-1},j]`$:
   - Graph Distance (Sgd)
   - Common Neighbors (Scn)
   - Jaccard’s Coefficient (Sjc)
   - Adamic / Adar (Sa)
   - Preferential Attachment (Spa)
 - ⚡Implementation of the Least Squares algorithm to solve the classification problem, given the previously calculated matrices.

## 🧠Technologies used:
 - Python
 - Numpy
 - Sklearn

## 🧰Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure your environment is properly configured.
 - Python 3.9+ is recommended
 - Required Libraries
 - Numpy (version 2.0.0 or newer)
 - Sci-kit learn

## 🧪How to Run
1. Clone the repository (or download and decompress the ZIP file).
```bash
git clone https://github.com/theofanistzoumakas/social-network-analysis.git
cd social-network-analysis
```

2. Specify the path to your dataset (make sure that your data are tuples with three elements -> (source node, destination node, timestamp))
```bash
f = open(“your_source_file”) //line 25
```
and
```bash
f = open(“your_source_file”) //line 36
```

3. Confirm that you have installed the required libraries.
4. Run the project.
5. You will recommended to type a number N. This number will split the data into N datasets.
6. Then view for the first split dataset the minimum time, maximum time, time duration, the first five timestamps.
7. For the first time period see:
  - Adjacency matrix.
  - Graph representation of centralities:
    - Degree Centrality.
    - In-Degree Centrality.
    - Out-Degree Centrality.
    - Closeness Centrality.
    - Betweenness Centrality.
    - Eigenvector Centrality.
    - Katz Centrality.
   - See matrices $`Ε^*[t_{j-1},t_j]`$, $`V^*[t_{j-1},t_{j+1}]`$ and $`Ε^*[t_j,t_{j+1}]`$.
     - And for $`V^*`$ see:
        - Graph Distance (Sgd).
		- Common Neighbors (Scn).
        - Jaccard’s Coefficient (Sjc).
		- Adamic / Adar (Sa).
		- Preferential Attachment (Spa).
8. See the success rates, mean square error and absolute square error from using Least Squares algorithm.

## 🎯Purpose
The purpose was to explore how useful information can be extracted from a social network, regarding the properties of users as well as the relationships between them over a specific period of time. **This application is developed solely for academic and research purposes**.
